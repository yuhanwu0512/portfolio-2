                   <p class="regular">This project is a capstone project collaborated with Ithaca Science Center. There is a room called "wall of inspiration" covered with plaques telling stories about prominent scientists. Those plaques are donated by a lot of companies to memorize them. Our task is to create a digital version of "wall of inspiration" to allow people play around with those plaques.   </p>
                </div>

               <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                   <h2>User Flow</h2>
                   <p class="regular">After confirming the requirements with our client, We had the consensus that our goal is to let people really look into those plaques and have fun with it. So we came up with four sections: Attract mode, search scientists, memory game and quiz game. Here is the user flow.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                   <img class="img-responsive" src="images/scienceuserflow.png">

                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                    <h2>Interface Design</h2>
                    <h3>Slideshow Mode and Menu</h3>
                <p class="regular">The slideshow mode is the default mode which will allow people walking by to view the plaques. We tested on 20 people to see their reading speed and set the slideshow time interval as 13 seconds. We also added two arrows which allow people to switch between plaques. In this way, people can scan more plaques and skip plaques they are not interested in. It also benefits people who read faster. When we did user testing later on the 'simple' slideshow mode, we found that people do not have the motivation to touch the screen, some of them even do not think there can be more things going on behind it. So I added a flickering icon to attract people to tap and explore.</p>
                <p class="regular">When people touch anywhere on the screen except the two arrows, the system will enter the main menu. There is a button that allows people go back to slideshow mode. Also, when no one touches the screen in 2 minutes, the system will automatically go back to slideshow mode.  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="fullscreen-section col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                 <img class="img-responsive" src="images/slideshow.png">
                </div> 
                
                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                    <h3>Search Scientists</h3>
                <p class="regular">The search mode was the touch part in this project for me. I struggled for a long time deciding which format should I use. I didn't have experience in designing for a large screen so my concern is how could I make everything in the system make more sense to people who is very used to interactions with laptops and cell phones while everything is easy to reach to in a large size screen.</p>
                <p class="regular">So I did some trials in the following prototypes. Firstly I tried to design our own keyboard because the default keyboard in Windows system is way too complex than what we need. However, I showed the design to some potential users, they can get it but they have never used this kind of keyboard before and they need time to adapt to it. That's when  I realized for this project, the goal is not to create new interactions but to provide the widely accepted way of interaction. So I decided to follow the format of web search.  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="fullscreen-section col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12">

                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                     <p class="regular">The final design is as follows. I removed the background picture because it will affect people reading words clearly and also made it easier to correspond to the other two modes visually. I also changed the search button to the left and just work as an icon because the search results will automatically appear after typing in keywords. For visual part, I took the color scheme of Ithaca science center and used pure color to keep it clean and simple.  </p>

                    <h3>Memory Game</h3>
                <p class="regular">The memory game is relatively simple and straightforward (when I was designing. It turned out that a lot of people are confused). After choosing a level, users click two plaques. If they are the same, these two will disappear. This level is passed when all plaques disappear.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fullscreen-section col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                 <img class="img-responsive" src="images/memory.png">
                </div> 
                
                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                    <h3>Quiz Game</h3>
                <p class="regular">How we are going to structure quiz game also took us a long time. Initially, our client wanted 3 levels with 10 questions per level. Before each question, users view 4 plaques and one will have the right answer. He also wants time controlling of each level, for example, 10 seconds for level 1 and 8 seconds for level2. If the user got one question right, he will get 1 point. If he got it wrong, the system will show the plaques again. This time if the user got it right, he will get 0.5 points.</p>
                    <p class="regular">What was challenging for me in this period is persuading our client but I succeeded eventually. After talking with some potential users. I emailed my client as follows:<I>"One thing is for this kind of game, scores do not matter much for people because there is no comparison unless we want to make a high record(which might easily reach to full score). They might care more about if they completed the game. So I would suggest they fail this level once they got wrong. If so, 10 questions might be a little bit more because we can not expect people to have that much patience. Also, I like how the timing thing differs levels. Does it also work if we add the number of plaques while the time keeps the same? The reason is we can expect people to read more plaques rather than shorten their time for reading plaques.</I></p>
                    <p class="regular">After our client agreed on my proposal, I tested on several potential users. Most of them think reading plaques is a big burden so I decided to add plaques as the level goes up and keep the time consistent. The final design is as follows.</p>
                    <p class="regular">On the test period, I found that users do not know where they should read at first and the seconds just went away. So I added an instruction to highlight where the answers came from.</p>

                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                    <h2>What to improve</h2>
                    <p class="regular">This is really an exciting project because our product has already been put to use! Since the time is limited, I think this project still have a long way to go to be perfect.</p>
                    <p class="regular">When it got in use, we observed people playing with it. The first problem is the arrow in slideshow mode is too small and the system might enter the menu even the user does not mean to. This problem has already been fixed by expanding the arrow areas into two stripes in both two sides.</p>
                    <p class="regular">The other big problem is in the memory mode. I took it for granted that all people know card memory game. While most people do not know what to do when first entered into the game. Some instructions is necessary.</p>
                    <p class="regular">The last thing that I feel not perfect is that large screen should have more fancy animations. While the time is limited and learning animations will be a huge burden for our developers. The animation I expect:</p>
