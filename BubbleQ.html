                    <p class="regular">This project is a semester-long MPS project. It provided us an pportunity to work with clients and use our skills to fulfill their needs. Our clients were Professor Dan Cosley and his PHD student Bin Xu from Relmagination Lab in Cornell. They are researching on different means of digital communication and our task was to design an App to reflect one of their concept. We also need to come up with an alternative design to compare with the concept. I was the UX Lead and Visual Designer on a team of three students with different backgrounds(engineering, finance).</p>
                    <p class="regular">The normal way of digital communication is that friends can send messages to each other without limit. The new means of communication our clients are exploring is that you can not send content to your friends without their permission. You can only tell them that you want to talk and it is their decision if they will let you talk. Vice versa.</p>
                    <p class="regular">This app mainly serves for research purpose rather than commercial purpose so we did not conduct user research and directly started to design the interface. After several rounds of discussion, we decided to use the metaphor "bubble" to reflect this concept. If you want to talk to someone, you have to receive a bubble sent by him first. </p>

                    <p class="regular">We used inVision to make an interactive prototype. Then we conducted 15 usability testings to test our prototype, 5 for each of the team members. We asked the users to finish 5 tasks: log in, send an empty bubble to a friend, fill in an bubble sent by others, read a filled bubble from others, make read bubbles disappear. We asked them to think aloud when they are using the prototype and took notes about how they operated and what they are thinking. Then we marked the UX problems and arranged their suggestions seperately. Finally, we used affinity diagram to summarize and figure out problems we are going to fix.</p>

                    <div id="setcolor">
                    <p class="regular">The people problem here is that when there are a lot of bubbles, it is difficult to find bubbles sent by certain users. We thought of many different ways to distinguish bubbles from each other: size of bubbles, shape of bubbles and colors of bubbles. Finally we decided to use color because the ability of people to distinguish different colors is very strong. Moreover, color can represent feelings sometimes. You can assign a bright color to indicate that you like the person and assign dark colors for people you don't like.</p></div>

                    <p class="regular">The overall style of bubbleQ is cute and playful. Through observation, we found that people like playing with bubbles and some of them say that they think it will be better to have something more playful in the app. 5 objects mentioned that they likes sending emojis when chatting through apps. Then our team came up with DIY emojis. Emoji can represent users' feelings with easy operation. Also, DIY emoji is a very playful feature. </p></div>

                <p class="regular">Till here, we finished the part of BubbleQ. The primary goal of BubbleQ is to serve our clients' research on digital communications, our team did our best to present the app for our client. BubbleQ is now available on App Store.
                    <br>Our secondary task was to come up with an alternative design which both reflects the concept of BubbleQ and includes other features people care about.

                    <p class="regular">For the alternative design, the concept matters. Therefore we went through brainstorm, storyboard and prototype sketch to figure out and display the concept.</p>
                     <h3>Brainstorm</h3>
                     <p class="regular">The goal of alternative design is to make comparison with BubbleQ in order to assist our clients' research. We need a design concept which conveys the similiar means of communication with BubbleQ while slightly different because of additional factors. Our team brainstormed from aspects of target groups and information they would like to share with each other. We ranked the information listed with how many target groups would like to share this kind of information and found out that <strong>location</strong> got the highest rank.</p>

                    <p class="regular">After we decided to work on the factor "location" and talked about dozens of ideas, we decided to work on an app called "Paperplane". Paperplane is a location-based app. People from different parts of the world can send empty paperplanes to people in another area that you are interested in. People who receive your paperplane will record a video of scenery there and fly it back to you.  </p>

                    <p class="regular">The interesting part of Paperplane is that we adopted the playfulness of BubbleQ into Paperplane. We designed an earth on the homepage, users can rotate the earth to find places they are interested in and put a paperplane there. It also uses the metaphor of flying a real paperplane.We also built a demo of interactive earth with Javascript.</p></div>
