                    <p class="regular">This summer I was an intern UX designer at Marketo. Every week I have a mentor from the team with different strengths in UX process taking me go deep into user research, system design, animation, visual design, etc. I also had two main projects and some side projects during the summer. I can really see myself grow fast as a UX designer!</p>

                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                    <p class="regular">Marketo is a marketing software. One main function is marketers can send massive emails out to their customers. The interface is as follows. (Do not laugh at our interface developed 10 years ago. Our team is working on a cool system redesign!)<p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                    <p class="regular"><b>The problem we want to solve is</b>: Based on former user research and feedback, timing is very important in marketing. Emails sent out at different time periods can have different effects. And it is the time of customers that matters but there is no easy way for marketers to send out emails based on their customers' time zones now.<p>
                    
                    <p class="regular">To solve this problem, we created a new feature called "Person Time Zone". If a user chooses to send at 8 AM 4th Aug, customers all over the world will receive this email at 8 AM 4th Aug, no matter if they are in the same time zone as the marketer. It seems like a simple logic, but I also need to think about how to deal with the situation that after a marketer set a time and didn't realize some parts of the globe has already passed this time. <p>
                    
                    <p class="regular"><b>Brainstorm and wireframes:</b>Taking consideration of time difference, the time needed to process emails and head start feature(start processing emails 12 hours earlier of the time set), this whole thing is actually very complex. First I tried to use simple word warnings to explain this situation.<p>
                    
                     <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

                <p class="regular">But reading those words is not intuitive and "reschedule if necessary" is not an elegant solution. We should care about every details in a product, show users the information they need and help them make decisions. Running out of word ideas, it came up to me that why don't I use data visualization to help users understand and make decisions?<p>

                <p class="regular">Above are part of exploration sketches. I decided to use map to tell users the warning information. I also added a pie chart to tell them how much percentage of customers have passed that time, so they can decide what to do with those customers. Besides those main information, I sketched all the possibility of interactions: radio buttons or combo box, should we show map in the beginning or hide it in a link, should we give access to smart lists, etc. I always share those sketches with my team and we will discuss the pros and cons of each design and make decisions together. One of my teammate suggested combine the map with the pie chart. This can not only make the interface simpler but also show the relation between map and pie chart. Below is the high-fidelity prototype based on our semi-final decision. <p>

                     <p class="regular"><b>Pilot User Testing</b>: After we settled down with the basic prototypes, I decided to do an informal user testing aimed mainly at if the two options are decent. I didn't prepare well for this test but my mentor gave me a lot of feedback after this. I wrote about this user test and things I learnt in a <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@yuhannwu/what-i-learned-from-a-ux-researcher-in-marketo-through-a-real-world-case-81b2c844dcd6">medium story</a>.<p>
                     <p class="regular"><b>Changes I Made</b>: I Added one more option which is send at the time in my timezone as a short cut to set time. I also decided to get rid of the access to smart list because they don't care about specific person.</p>
