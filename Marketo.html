                    <p class="regular">This summer I was an intern UX designer at Marketo. Every week I have a mentor from the team with different strengths in UX process taking me go deep into user research, system design, animation, visual design, etc. I also had two main projects and some side projects during the summer. I can really see myself growing as a UX designer!</p>

                    <p class="regular">Marketo is a marketing software. One main function is marketers can send massive emails out to their customers. The interface of sending emails is as follows. (Do not laugh at our interface developed 10 years ago. Our team is working on a cool system redesign!)<p>
                </div>

                    <h3>The problem we want to solve:</h3>
                    <p class="regular">Based on former user research and feedback, timing is very important in marketing. Emails sent out at different time periods can have different open rates and click rates which are the main success metrics for marketing by emails. For most companies with global customers, they always need to create different email programs for customers in different time zones which need a lot of duplicated operations and are very time- consuming. <p>
                    
                    <p class="regular">To solve this problem, we created a new feature called "Person Time Zone"(PTZ) at first. If a user chooses to send at 8 AM 4th Aug in PTZ, customers all over the world will receive this email at 8 AM 4th Aug, no matter if they are in the same time zone as the marketer. It seems like a simple logic, but I also need to think about how to deal with the situation that after a marketer set a time and didn't realize some parts of the globe has already passed this time, also how to redesign the track page. <p>
                    
                    <h3>Brainstorm and wireframes:</h3> 
                    <p class="regular">Taking consideration of time difference, the time needed to process emails and head start feature(start processing emails 12 hours earlier of the time set), this whole thing is actually very complex. First I tried to use simple word warnings to explain this situation.<p>
                    
                     <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                  <img class="img-responsive" src="images/tzlowfi1.png">

                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                <p class="regular">But reading those words is not intuitive and "reschedule if necessary" is not an elegant solution. One of the most important things I learned in this internship is every detail in a product matters. This project seems like just a simple warning page but it's all the details that make a product complete. We always need to show users the information they need and help them make decisions. Then it came up to me that why don't I use data visualization to help users understand and make decisions?<p>
                    </div> 

                
                <div class="fullscreen-section col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                  <img class="img-responsive" src="images/tzlowfi2.png">
                  
                </div>

                    <p class="regular">Above are part of exploration sketches. I decided to use a map to tell users the warning information because it is the most intuitive way to tell things about time zones. I also added a pie chart to tell them how much percentage of customers have passed that time, so they can decide what to do with those customers. Besides those main information, I sketched all the possibility of interactions: radio buttons or combo box, should we show the map in the beginning or hide it in a link, should we give access to smart lists, etc. I always share those sketches with my team and we will discuss the pros and cons of each design and make decisions together. One of my teammates suggested combining the map with the pie chart. This can not only make the interface simpler but also show the relation between map and pie chart. The second picture is the exploration of track page. I decided to go with pie chart because it follows the existing model so it will not be hard for users to adapt to and keeps consistency with other track pages. Below is the high-fidelity prototype based on our semifinal decision. </p>

                     <h3>Pilot User Testingï¼š</h3>
                     <p class="regular"> After we settled down with the basic prototypes, I decided to do an informal user testing aimed mainly at if the two options are decent. I didn't prepare well for this test but my mentor gave me a lot of feedback after this. I wrote about this user test and things I learned in a <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@yuhannwu/what-i-learned-from-a-ux-researcher-in-marketo-through-a-real-world-case-81b2c844dcd6">medium story</a>.<p>
                     <p class="regular">Changes I Made: I Added one more option which is "send at the time in my time zone" which is the default setting. I also decided to get rid of the access to the smart list because the user said they won't care about a specific person.</p>
                     <h3>4 External User Testings:</h3> <p class="regular">I created an <a target="_blank" href="https://invis.io/DVCMBIT6T">invision prototype</a> and designed 9 tasks to conduct the four external user testing. They are all users all over the world so all the tests are done remotely. The tasks are: <br>
                         1) What will you do if you want to send emails in PTZ mode? <br>
                         2) Can you read the notes in the page and explain to me what does this mean? (Asks for every sentence) <br>
                         3) Now please schedule an email at XX AM, July XX (Date based on the day of user testing). <br>
                         4) Can you tell me what information can you get out of this map and will this affect your decision and why? <br>
                         5) Can you read the three options and explain to me what will happen when you choose each one of them? <br>
                         6) What will you do if you want to send now?<br>
                         7) What will you do if you changed you mind about what to do for leads who passed the time?<br>
                         8) Can you read the tooltip for head start and explain what does this mean?<br>
                         9) What information can you get out of this track page?<br><br>
                    I also asked them what information they expect to see and got a lot of valuable insights from them. Here is one of the video record:</div>

                     <h3>Iteration:</h3>
                     <p class="regular"> I kept the user testing process agile. Those user testings are all arranged on different days so once I got feedback from one user I will make some changes based on my findings and also test with the next user. That's why I there are different versions of task 9. The exciting thing is that user understands the newer versions better! As we can see from the task score, I really need to change the tooltip to make it more clear and easy to understand. Also, users talked a lot about the track page and their expectations. So I took the initiative and asked my manager if I can redesign the track page. A few users talked about how they deal with customers in multiple time zones and they all have the need of analyzing data from time zones separately, sometimes they will do some calculations among time zones to find out universal habits in certain areas. That's why after the user testings I feel the importance of showing more detailed information to users. Based on the new findings, here comes the new design for track page (played around with Principle in the meantime!): </p>

                      <source src="trackpagenew.mov" type="video/mp4" />
                </video>
                     <p class="regular">I talked with the front-end developer who works on this project and we got a problem. She said in the existing model, we can not control the opens widget with the pie chart widget. She needs to do some research about this and suggested me to come up with a back-up design. So for the backup design I put a drop down menu on the top to control every widget. Let see what will happen... <br> It is the first time experiencing how picky it is to choose every single word for a product in the industry!! Also, there are so many details that I iterated in the whole process and it will be too much if I list them all. Different from projects in school, I really feel the obligation and responsibility to take every detail seriously because it will really affect marketers! </p>
                     <h3>My thoughts:</h3>
                     <p class="regular">This project really means a lot to me as a UX designer. It gave me the opportunity to experience how design can really make people's lives easier. When I was doing user testings, there is one user, after I introduce this concept to her, she actually yelled on the other side of BlueJeans, saying "Yay we have been waiting for this for so long" and she showed me how she has been using those time zone calculation Apps to solve this problem by herself. Another user who is in England and I need to be in the office at 8 AM. But after she flowed the design flow perfectly without any confusion and kept saying "This is so cool, if I have this last week I didn't need to schedule 20 different engagement programs". I believe a designer can never feel more satisfaction than that moment.</p>
