                    <p class="regular">This summer I was an intern UX designer at Marketo. Every week I have a mentor from the team with different strengths in UX process taking me go deep into user research, system design, animation, visual design, etc. I also had two main projects and some side projects during the summer. I can really see myself growing as a UX designer! <br>See projects I worked on below:</p>

                    <h2>Product Requirement (Problem Identification):</h2>
                    <p class="regular">Marketo is a marketing software. One main function is marketers can send massive emails out to their customers. The interface of sending emails is as follows. (Do not laugh at our interface developed 10 years ago. Our team is working on a cool system redesign!)<p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                  <img class="img-responsive" src="images/tzstart.png">
                </div>
                
                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

                    <p class="regular">Based on former user research and feedback, timing is very important in marketing. Emails sent out at different time periods can have different open rates and click rates which are the main success metrics for marketing by emails. For most companies with global customers, they always need to create different email programs for customers in different time zones which need a lot of duplicated operations and are very time- consuming. <p>
                    
                    <p class="regular">To solve this problem, we created a new feature called "Person Time Zone"(PTZ) at first. If a user chooses to send at 8 AM 4th Aug in PTZ, customers all over the world will receive this email at 8 AM 4th Aug, no matter if they are in the same time zone as the marketer. It seems like a simple logic, but I also need to think about how to deal with the situation that after a marketer set a time and didn't realize some parts of the globe has already passed this time, also how to redesign the track page. <p>
                    
                    <h2>Brainstorm and quick sketching:</h2> 
                    <p class="regular">Taking consideration of time difference, the time needed to process emails and head start feature(start processing emails 12 hours earlier of the time set), this whole thing is actually very complex. First I tried to use simple word warnings to explain this situation.<p>
                    
                     <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                  <img class="img-responsive" src="images/tzlowfi1.png">
                </div>
                </div>
                        
        
                
                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                <p class="regular">But reading those words is not intuitive and "reschedule if necessary" is not an elegant solution. One of the most important things I learned in this internship is every detail in a product matters. This project seems like just a simple warning page but it's all the details that make a product complete. We always need to show users the information they need and help them make decisions. Then it came up to me that why don't I use data visualization to help users understand and make decisions?<p>
                    </div> 

                
                <div class="fullscreen-section col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                  <img class="img-responsive" src="images/tzlowfi2.png">
                  
                </div>
                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="images/tzhifi.png">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="images/track%20page%20initial.png">
                </div>
                
                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                    <p class="regular">Above are part of exploration sketches. I decided to use a map to tell users the warning information because it is the most intuitive way to tell things about time zones. I also added a pie chart to tell them how much percentage of customers have passed that time, so they can decide what to do with those customers. Besides those main information, I sketched all the possibility of interactions: radio buttons or combo box, should we show the map in the beginning or hide it in a link, should we give access to smart lists, etc. I always share those sketches with my team and we will discuss the pros and cons of each design and make decisions together. One of my teammates suggested combining the map with the pie chart. This can not only make the interface simpler but also show the relation between map and pie chart. The second picture is the exploration of track page. I decided to go with pie chart because it follows the existing model so it will not be hard for users to adapt to and keeps consistency with other track pages.  </p>
    
                    </div>
            
              
                
                 <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                     <h2>Customer Testing & Iteration</h2>
                     <h3>Internal(Pilot) Customer Testing：</h3>
                     <p class="regular"> After we settled down with the basic prototypes, I decided to do an informal user testing aimed mainly at if the two options are decent. I didn't prepare well for this test but my mentor gave me a lot of feedback after this. I wrote about this user test and things I learned in a <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@yuhannwu/what-i-learned-from-a-ux-researcher-in-marketo-through-a-real-world-case-81b2c844dcd6">medium story</a>.<p>
                     <p class="regular">Changes I Made: I Added one more option which is "send at the time in my time zone" which is the default setting. I also decided to get rid of the access to the smart list because the user said they won't care about a specific person.</p>
                     <h3>External Customer Testings:</h3> <p class="regular">I created an <a target="_blank" href="https://invis.io/DVCMBIT6T">invision prototype</a> and designed 9 tasks to conduct the four external user testing. They are all users all over the world so all the tests are done remotely. The tasks are: <br>
                         1) What will you do if you want to send emails in PTZ mode? <br>
                         2) Can you read the notes in the page and explain to me what does this mean? (Asks for every sentence) <br>
                         3) Now please schedule an email at XX AM, July XX (Date based on the day of user testing). <br>
                         4) Can you tell me what information can you get out of this map and will this affect your decision and why? <br>
                         5) Can you read the three options and explain to me what will happen when you choose each one of them? <br>
                         6) What will you do if you want to send now?<br>
                         7) What will you do if you changed you mind about what to do for leads who passed the time?<br>
                         8) Can you read the tooltip for head start and explain what does this mean?<br>
                         9) What information can you get out of this track page?<br><br>
                    I also asked them what information they expect to see and got a lot of valuable insights from them. Here is one of the video record:</div>

                     <h3>Iteration:</h3>
                     <p class="regular"> I kept the user testing process agile. Those user testings are all arranged on different days so once I got feedback from one user I will make some changes based on my findings and also test with the next user. That's why I there are different versions of task 9. The exciting thing is that user understands the newer versions better! As we can see from the task score, I really need to change the tooltip to make it more clear and easy to understand. Also, users talked a lot about the track page and their expectations. So I took the initiative and asked my manager if I can redesign the track page. A few users talked about how they deal with customers in multiple time zones and they all have the need of analyzing data from time zones separately, sometimes they will do some calculations among time zones to find out universal habits in certain areas. That's why after the user testings I feel the importance of showing more detailed information to users. Based on the new findings, here comes the new design for track page (played around with Principle in the meantime!): </p>

                     <h2>Design Review and 😭:</h2>
                     <p class="regular">After the consensus among my manager and the product manager, we moved to the step of design review. This is my first design review in industry and it really made me realize that there is still a long way to go to become a great designer. </p>
                     <p class="regular">I created several user flows and practiced for many times walking through from a user's perspective. I was confident at first but didn't realize things will go on in a way I didn't expect at all.</p>
                     <p class="regular">As I started presenting my "delicate designed flow", people started to throw questions at me, some of which I didn't even think of before. For example, I didn't know there can be a lot of customers who we may not have time zone record so there are no corresponding solutions. The front-end developer questioned the feasibility and the cost of track page design. And generally, people think my design is way too complicated for this simple feature. My design was piled up bit by bit and I was really upset.</p>
                     <p class="regular">When I walked out the meeting room, my teammates who were in that meeting started to comfort me saying things like "Don't be upset, this is what may happen in design reviews." Actually, It only took me a couple of minutes to be upset, then I started to reflect what went wrong in this design process. I concluded into 2 things: <br>
                         • <b>Didn't involve stakeholders</b>: There are a lot of problems brought up in the design review can be avoided in advance by involving all stakeholders. By talking with the director of PM who has been working on Marketo for 8 years and knows everything about it, I would be able to know some factors I need to take into consideration. By talking with front-end developers, I can now some existing restrictions. <br>
                         • <b>Big picture & Details</b>: As time goes on, I tend to dig into details of this feature. Also, the more users I talked with, the more needs they will bring up and the nature of a UXer is to fulfill them. Those result in the fact that I brought too much complexity into this feature.

                <p class="regular">The dropdown menu is not intuitive enough, so I changed it into radio buttons and elaborated what does LTZ mean. For simplicity, I saved the trouble of making choice every time there is a conflict and just put it into a setting. I also took customers who don't have time zone data into consideration. Also, I decided to get rid of the interaction between email send and opens. </p>

                     <h2>New UI System 😻:</h2>
                    <p class="regular">When I was working on Send in Lead Time Zone which is based on the old system, it was a little bit bothering because this system was built ten years ago and there is no UI library at all! There is no standard in terms of drawing each element and it also takes a lot of effort to develop it.</p>
                    <p class="regular">Luckily! Marketo is building a new UI system which will be released for testing in late September. I helped with our visual designer on the UI library and re-layout some screens.</p>
                    <h3>UI Library</h3>
                    <p class="regular">This is the UI library that our visual designer created. This is my first time working on a real UI library and it is so exciting for me because it can really improve the efficiency of the whole design process.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="images/uilib.png"> 
                    <h3>Small part of my work</h3>
                    <p class="regular">These are just 2 out of 20+ screens I worked on. The main challenges for me are <br>
                        (1) to understand all the information structure so I can map every information with the right UI element.<br>
                    (2) for elements that we don't have an existing pattern in the UI library, I need to create this certain element.<br>
                    (3) what is the best layout of each screen?</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="images/clone.png"> 
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="images/social.png"> 
                    <p class="regular">To overcome the first challenge, I put a lot of effort learning and understanding a lot of details about how Marketo and marketing work. That's also when I felt how interesting UX design is. UX design is never an independent discipline. It is just like a girl who has great adaptability.(I wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/@yuhannwu/ux-design-is-just-like-a-girl-who-have-adaptability-58cf14e7f5d3">medium article</a> about this thought!) Only when I understand every screen thoroughly can I figure out the correct information structure!</p>
                    <p class="regular">To overcome the second challenge, also the challenge of which layout works best, what I did was actually simple:<br>(1) sketch out every possibility of the elements and layouts <br>(2) ask people for opinions and further suggestions <br>(3) synthesize all the feedback I got and make a final decision.<br> <br>A little reflection now: <br> I was always wondering, why did I tend to ask people for opinions and is it the right way to do design? But recently I took a class called "crowdsourcing and human computing". There is a scientific theory "The Condorcet Jury Theorem" says that when the chance of every person in a group is right is better than a random answer, as the number of people grows, the final answer tends to reach 100% correct. </p>
                    <p class="regular">From my personal understanding, UI library or atom design is quite a breakthrough and I believe there are more breakthroughs we can find in design！</p>

                  <h1 id="project3">Project 3: Labels in Mercury System</h1>
                     <h2>Problem We Are Solving：</h2>
                    <p class="regular">Marketo is developing a new UI system "Mercury". In the Marketo App, every time a marketer creates a program, there will be a tree node. Based on previous user research, many customers have tons of program tree nodes and it's so hard for them to manage, search and view reports. We got a requirement from product managers that we are introducing labels into the Mercury system where a user can put a label on a program for future search and reports.</p>
                     <h2>Start With Core Function</h2>
                     <p class="regular">The Beta of Mercury system will be tested with 25 users in late September so for labels, we are only presenting the core functions in this period which are:<br>• Add labels to a program on creating<br>• Delete labels on creating<br>• Edit labels in asset detail page   </p>
                     </div>
                     <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                         <h2>Quick Prototyping</h2>        
                   <img class="img-responsive" src="images/Create%20Start.png"> 
                   <P class="regular">This is the low-fi of our new system. The main interaction we are changing is the labels part. Before we get started, we researched on how other platforms performed on features similar to labels and did a quick prototyping.</P>
                   <p class="regular">The process of designing label feature is very agile. We hold design review frequently with PMs and developers.</p>
                   
                   <h2>Version 1</h2>
                   <video width="880" height="567" autoplay loop>
                      <source src="version1.mov" type="video/mp4" />
                   </video>
                         <p class="regular">The initial version was very basic and had a lot of problems. The adding label interaction is not considerable enough and the logic about inherit is not clear.</p>
                   <h2>Version 2</h2>
                    <video width="880" height="567" autoplay loop>
                      <source src="version2.mov" type="video/mp4" />
                   </video>
                         <p class="regular">Version 2 specified the interaction of adding labels with auto fill, put the focus on the first item, label removed from the list when applied and already applied notification. Also, we changed the interaction of clicking plus button to create new label into word button and this label will be applied when created. Moreover, the copy label logic allows users to have more flexibility. </p>  
                    <h2>Version 3</h2>
                      <video width="900" height="567" autoplay loop>
                      <source src="version3.mov" type="video/mp4" />
                   </video> 
                    <p class="regular">In version 3, we considered every detail of interactions. For the problem of copy label and limit, we came up with a more elegant solution which is a user can either add labels by himself or copy from the parent.</p>
                    
                    <h2>My Thoughts: How is industry different from school projects</h2>
                         <p class="regular">The <b>process</b> of designing label feature has nothing similar to a standard UX process. We didn't do user research because both customers and the product team has been talking about this feature for a long time so we know it's an existing and solid need.</p>
                         <p class="regular">Usually school projects will not impact a lot of people so every time we came up with something, we just do a few design critics and then move on. However, the design we are doing in industry will really impact customers and satisfaction from them. For this label feature, although I only put 3 versions of design here, we actually had at least 5 meetings. Every time there will be people bringing up new suggestions. <b>One thing I think I still need to learn is how to distinguish suggestions that I should take in and others to be neglected, also the ability to know when is the time to call an end of this design in certain time period.</b> </p>
                         <p class="regular">Another thing that worth mention is in our new system, we have a UI library so we only need to deliver low-fidelity prototype. Front-end developers will use UI library to input product directly. It will save a lot of time and will keep everything consistent. The thing I learned here is design strategy is quite important in industry. <b>Before we start working, we should have a profound strategy which ensures that we can build the best product with the least effort</b>.</p>
                         <p class="regular">The design review for labels is the last work I did during the internship. I feel good that there are much fewer problems brought up in this session compared with the first one. We have more solid user flow and covered all details people can think about. The only regret is I can not stay until the feature is released. 😢 </p>

                  <h1 id="project4">Project 4: Loading Animation</h1>
                    <p class="regular">Marketo is developing a new system with new UX and UI. One of my tasks is to design the animation when a user is loading into the new system. </p>
                    <h2>Branding First:</h2>
                    <p class="regular">An important thing I learned in this internship is our product should always speak for the brand. So the first thing we did was talking with the creative department and internal employees to understand the brand we are trying to show to our customers. After we got all the resources, we landed on some keywords: <br>• Customers first<br>• Professional yet playful<br>• Energetic<br>• Complicated yet simple</p>
                    <h2>Brainstorm and Demo</h2>
                    <p class="regular">I started to think of a short animation which can tell a story which can tell a story about the brand we want to convey to our customers. After a few brainstorms, we came up with this animation: </p>
                </div>
                <div id="animationvideo" class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                <video width="840" height="567" autoplay loop>
                      <source src="loadingAni.mov" type="video/mp4" />
                </video>
                </div>
                <div class="project-real-content col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                    <p class="regular">This animation tells a story:<br> The bouncing ball represents our customer, the four bars mean Marketo. Our goal is to help our customer jump higher. The last jump represents the success of our customer. After our customer achieves success, the circle completes which can either mean customer's success makes Marketo complete or Marketo and customer families.  </p>
                    <p class="regular">The animation corresponds to the brand because it highlights the importance of our customers. It tells the value of our company yet stays in a playful manner.</p>
                    <h2>Skeleton Screens</h2>
                    <p class="regular">The concern of that animation is it will be too complicated if we show it every time when there is a page loading. That's why we decided that the animation above will only be used when the user is loading into our system. Inside the app, we will use skeleton loading.</p>
                    <p class="regular">A skeleton screen gives a visual cue that content is loading one after the other into each UI element area. It has been found that skeleton screens play a major role in the perception of users who appear to think that these are not as slow as spinners or progress bars.</p>

                     <h1 id="project5">Project 5: Redesign Support Space Website</h1>
                     <h2>Design Help Meet-up</h2>
                     <p class="regular">This project was a design help for customer support department. The original website was built a long time ago and is super complicated and confusing. People from the support department needed our help reorganizing the information structure and overall layout. The original website looks like this:</p>
                      <img class="img-responsive" src="images/supportoriginal.png"> 
                     <h2>Cart Sorting and the Failure 😂 </h2>
                     <p class="regular">After we audited the website by ourselves, we found there is too many information on this website and some of them are even duplicated. We want to know what information the users are really using and card sorting could be the best way. We created a card sorting with an online tool. Users can sort the features based on the frequency of use.  </p>
                     <p class="regular">We got a list of registered users and sent out emails asking for help. We expect that we could get a lot of feedback but things didn't turn out as we think... We only got 2 responses!!</p>
                     <img class="img-responsive" src="images/card.png">
                     <p class="regular">It was also funny that on the second day, there was a major crash of our domain and a lot of customers are so annoyed. It would be a terrible timing if we keep sending out emails.</p>
                     <h2>Taking off & Redesign layout</h2>
                     <p class="regular">Although we only got two responses, we can still find out something from it. And we do think this website can be redesigned just based on current UX standard. So we got started with 2 results! We took off a lot of crazily complicated features like filter and used a more universal way of filtering most websites use now.</p>
                      <h3>Identify Minimal Viable Product</h3>
                     <p class="regular">After talking with our stakeholders, we know that the main goal people are visiting this website is to post the problems they have or find answers to their questions.</p>
                     <p class="regular">The interesting part of this project is that there is another group of users who are the IT support members. They told us that there are always people asking questions that have been asked and solved before. So to save the trouble of direct users posting questions and the trouble of support people answering duplicated questions, we want to encourage users to search for answers first. Post only when there isn't any. The search and post should be related instead of being put in different sessions in the original design.</p>
                      <img class="img-responsive" src="images/supportsearch.png">
                     <h3>How to make it less busy</h3>
                     <p class="regular">We figured out the main problem that makes this website look busy is there are too many sporadic patches like customer hero, customer satisfaction, feedback and contact. They are surrounding the main content, taking attention from the users. Our solution for this is that we put all those patches into bubbles and align them to one side. People can use it when hovering on it. It will not be disturbing but are always there when needed.</p>
                      <img class="img-responsive" src="images/supportHover.png">
                    <h3>New Filter</h3>
                     <p class="regular">In the past, I think whenever we are designing, there should be data backing up my decision. However, now I figured out that there are some cases that we don't really need wasting time and effort because there are already successful patterns to follow. Here I am talking about filter. Filter is used everywhere and there are certain patterns that most people are already familiar with. That how we landed on the new design of filter. </p>
                     <p class="regular">Before:</p>
                     <img class="img-responsive" src="images/before.png">
                     <p class="regular">After:</p>
                      <img class="img-responsive" src="images/after.png">
                     <h2>What I learned:</h2>
                     <h3>Flexibility</h3>
                     <p class="regular">When I first got this project, I was thinking of a profound user research plan. We didn't do that in the end but the stakeholders were still satisfied with what we have. This experience taught me to stay flexible in design. It is good to keep design process in mind, but sometimes we can follow existing patterns and save a lot of meaningless effort. </p>
                    
                     <h3>Minimal Viable Product</h3>
                      <p class="regular">My mentor also mentioned this term when we were working on labels. As designers, we always start with MVP in our subconscious. However, we might switch our attention to some unnecessary details as time goes on. I learned that we should always keep this concept in mind, all the details should serve MVP during the problem. Only by this, we are attacking the main problem we are facing.</p>
